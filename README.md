# LearningJava-Code

The course lectures, assignments and assignment solution source codes for "LearningJava" course. The course is primarily aimed at begineers with little or no knowledge of java.

Note: 
If you are using the source codes folder to check your solutions with mine or even running it to see the output, then please take special care on how you set up your project any IDEs out there. 

The following codes were written on Eclipse Ganymede IDE, so if you happen to use the same IDE then download the "Java Course Codes" folder and extract the project files from "\bin\ ..." or "\src\ ..." and not "Java Course Codes\bin\ ..." or "Java Course Codes\src\ ..."

Have fun!
